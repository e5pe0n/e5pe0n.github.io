## Overview

|Month|Project|
|:---:|:---:|
|01|Assistant System for Government Cloud Management|
|02-12|WebRTC PaaS|

- entered new company and joined new project
  - webrtc paas
  - about 30 members
    - kind, skilled, talented and passionate
- learned a lot of new things
  - webrtc
  - service maintenance
  - typescript

## WebRTC

- webrtc is a protocol stack to achieve real-time communication, mainly using media such as audio and video via p2p
  - tutorial is easy
    - browsers provide simple apis for webrtc so app developers can easily use them in javascript and implement real-time communication apps if they are simple just like sample apps
  - the protocol stack is very complex
    - webrtc is not a just single protocol, but a protocol stack; consisting of many existing protocols like srtp, sctp, ice, udp, etc.
    - these protocols were not tailored only for webrtc, and webrtc just uses part of them
    - but to master webrtc, understanding those specification and actual working in detail can't be avoided
    - i know that making my hands dirty and implementing something by my self is an important step to understand and satisfy my curious
      - actually i started to write [stun/turn server in ts](https://github.com/e5pe0n/turn-ts)
      - it was for the first time to me to implement something following a specification like RFC
      - and was good for study about networking
    - but at the same time i feel that implementing webrtc from the bottom of the protocol stack could be kinda waste of time because webrtc is not using those protocol fully 
      - it would be good to touch only the part of those protocols on which webrtc depends if can...
      - at least i wanna understand how rtp works for real-time media connection
    - also knowledge about audio/video encoding is necessary
  - just trying webrtc is easy, but controlling, optimizing and maintaining the service using webrtc is super hard
    - webrtc itself is complex
    - characteristics like real-time, asynchronous and of networking make the service more complicated
- i often watch game streams on youtube or twitch so am interested in vod or real-time content delivery
  - there are other protocols such as hls, rtmp, moqt, etc.
  - i wanna get closer to it
  - also i have a lot of benefit from remote working
  - glad to enter such a field which is challenging but interesting

## twada-juku

- entered to a study course mainly for tdd by t-wada
  - i was already familiar with tdd but i got more confidence and structured knowledge thought the course
  - developed a simple crud web app
    - frontend
      - [vite](https://vite.dev/)
      - react
    - backend
      - [fastify](https://fastify.dev/)
      - [kysely](https://kysely.dev/)
        - tried a query builder
        - good to write sql type-safely
        - converting rows to object or vice versa was rough than i unexpected
  - deployed it onto cloud run
- test size
  - problem is that words like unit, integration, e2e have ambiguity
  - define test size and name them like small, middle and large; the number of tests should shape pyramid

## TypeScript

- improved developer experience of dev team
  - update obsoleted packages
  - fixed type errors and reduced suppressed type errors like using `@ts-ignore`, `any` or so on
    - defined correct and flexible types
  - replaced eslint with [biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
    - eslint v9 introduced new config format called flat config
    - migration from >= v8 seemed not easy
    - biome is much faster than eslint
  - enabled to run app without source code build leveraging type inference and conditional exports
  - introduced [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
    - better performance than npm
    - secure node_modules structure
    - one of biggest motivation is that pnpm has features for mono repo such as [workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces), [recursive command run](https://pnpm.io/cli/recursive), [prune other app code](https://pnpm.io/docker), etc.
  - introduced [zod](https://zod.dev/)
    - modern and ts-community standard schema validation library
    - there were many complex type guards written manually in our codebase
      - writing complicated type guards manually is error-prone
  - introduced [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
    - publish js-sdk packages on ci/cd; reduce the operation time to a half of it


## WASM

- learned what wasm is
  - wasm seems to be thought like the next tech of container?
- developed a ts library that loads wasm
  - used vite

## Scrum

- struggled team management
  - our team has responsibility for develop and operation (not only deployment and server operation but also user's dev support)
  - unexpected incidents and tech supports had made our planning difficult and taken away the time for development
    - => calculated velocity and introduced buffer to time we can use for the sprint based on it
- utilized my knowledge and experience on scrum
  - make scrum events smooth
    - they had surly applied scrum framework but the development was not agile at all
    - they've taken so much time for daily scrum, retrospective, and planning
      - 2 hours daily scrum, 2 days retrospective and planning, or so...
    - => set time box and shortened the time taken for events
      - had them focus on the topic of discussion
      - if discussion prolong and it's not about team management, schedule an isolated meeting about it
  - had them focus on the sprint goal
    - i think it's important for team to work together to achieve one important thing 
    - velocity had been low
    - => set sprint goal like "make A enable to B" (define who is A and what is B explicitly)
      - led team to more like "we're creating/committing to good product!"
      - encouraged mob working e.g. mob-programming
      - => the number of in-progress tasks decreased and the number of done tasks increased (burn-down chart became to decrease constantly)
