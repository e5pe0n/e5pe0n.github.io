### Programming Languages

#### JS/TS

it was soooooooooooo big for me to have learn about JavaScript/TypeScript deeply.
- JS/TS is the best language for me so far.
  - i can write code easily.
    - i can write both frontend and backend in just JS/TS only.
      - i knew that it's hard so much to keep learning and using some languages in practice.
    - rich syntaxies and language features
      - array function
        - this is a very big feature to those who like functional style.
      - spread syntax, object destruction, promise, await/async etc
    - transpile
      - always work in the newest JS/TS version
        - JS has many pitfalls that are awkward and surprise novices.
        - new syntaxies or language structures have been released to replace them although old ones will remain in the future for backward-compatibility.
        - but we can always write program safely and comfortably in the newest JS/TS version, then transpile it to a target older version so we don't worry about the old language features.
      - prototyping or tracer bullet
        - i can ignore compile errors from TS and emit the build product anyway.
        - this flexibility is useful for prototyping or tracer bullet
          - in early stage, implement roughly to think of specification details
          - then gradually get it strict for realistic system
    - static analysis
      - i can catch bugs not at runtime but at compile time
      - type safe
        - TS gives me useful infomation about a variable, funciton, or so when i'm writing code
        - TS notifies me even typos by using *String Union*
    - structural type
      - it's more flexible and useful for web development than nominal type
  - it's popular
    - someone said that googlability is preferable to language goodness. it's one of truths
    - supported by many services and platforms
      - AWS
    - a lot of frameworks and libraries provided by communities
- demand to master JS
  - JS is popular but i feel that those mastering JS is less than i expect

#### Python

- i still think that Python is a good language
  - simple syntax
  - useful language features and built-in functions
  - we can run an implementation anyway because of dynamically interpreted.
  - we can add type infomation using *typehint*.
  - popular
    - many books about Python
    - many services and platforms support Python
    - many libraries and platforms published by communities
- but i feel that it might not satisfy strictness to develop a production.  
  - type system is insufficient
    - VSCode often doesn't show up type information even when using *typehint*
    - these is no compile time error; just all occur runtime
  - less maintainancibility
    - there is no constant variable in Python
- for my preference
  - the syntax is not for functional sytle
    - not type safe
    - *lambda* function can be written in only one line
    - it's difficult to chain functions

#### Haskell/Scheme

- writing programs in Haskell and Scheme was very good excercise to implement logics in functional programming style.  
  - i got familiar with the recursion.

### Development

#### Test

- i wrote tests right for the first time.
- i spent a lot of time to learn how to write tests, and implement actually and run tests properly...
  - Pytest
  - Jest
  - React Testing Library
    - not easy to use...
    - GUI test is more difficult than tests for backend.
    - i don't know React design pattern to make tests easy.
      - i can't divide a form component into API fetching and renderer.
- i knew that writing test take more time than implementing features.
  - it makes me to consider testability while implementing features.
    - i got to be to prefer functional programming style.  

### Algorithms

- AtCoder and *Cracking the Coding Interview* was very good practice to implement algorithms.
  - when i'm in trouble to implement logics in ordinal development declined.
  - i can easily modify an existing data structure or implement a new custom data structure if needed
- search algorithms such as DFS and BFS is most useful for me.
  - i can manage to implement so many logic using DFS if i can ignore the time complexity.
  - to constrast, i've had no chance to use algorithms regard to the number theory in app developement.

### AWS

- i was astonished by the number of services and configurability at first.
  - examples in official docs are too few so i had to had so many trials and errors to deploy properly.
  - i knew that each service has the depth to experiment and configure options to optimize the perfomance.
  - but i could know the convinience of cloud service and the power of infrustructure as a code.  
    - i implemented a web app backend in a template file.
      - we can manage infrustructures in VCS
      - we can copy it and create the same another environment easily
      - we can deploy and delete it easily
- i didn't take exam for Certified Solution Architect finally.
  - i want to use time for other things to learn and i feel that it's better to work actually rather than memorize details including possibly unnecessary knowledge

### English

- i've read about 20-30 books written in English this year.
- i've bought Japanese books about math or programming no longer.
  - i noticed that when there are things difficult to understand in English, they are also difficult in Japanese.
  - why it's difficult to understand them is not because the English texts are difficult, just because they themselves are complicated.
  - if the difference is little, it's better to read and learn about them in English because i can learn and practice English at the same time.

- my English skills are *reading* >> *writing* > *listening* > *speaking*.
  - *reading* was improved so much.
    - i'm no longer in trouble when i read refarences or manuals in English.
    - vocabulary is still poor.
      - there are so many words i can't read.
      - i can't understand jokes or parables.
      - i don't know about casual or daily English at all
        - i'm now just specific to programming or math.
  - *writing*
    - writing is still slow but i feel it get to be better.
    - i became to be able to write documents about sysmtes or tools.
    - i can't write casual English.
      - i can't chat by chat apps.
  - *listening*, *speaking*
    - it's stil not good but improved by
      - watching youtube videos, explaining programming launguages, frameworks, algorithms or so, with CC feature.
      - reading books aloud

## What Next?

- i want to implement a middle or large system
- i want to make apps
  - my blog
    - i want this to be a platform to exhibit my implementations
      - not only interesting but also entertainable or artistic
  - study app
    - like *izanami jinja* i made before
- i want to read
