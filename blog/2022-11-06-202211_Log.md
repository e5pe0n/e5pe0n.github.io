## Something

- tooooooo busy this month
  - woke up at 6:00 then worked from 7:00 to 23:00
  - tight schedule made me increase the speed and concentration to implement
  - but couldn't progress my study and programming other than work for job
  - i'm already tired and hard to keep motivation
    - only hope is my PM; he is a really good PM, manages to reschedule as much as possible and encourages me
- i'm wondering it's good for me to spend such time in my life on working at current company



## Music

- Capsule / Sana
