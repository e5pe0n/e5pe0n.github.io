- finally i got a new job and am working since Feb!
  - about paas for real-time communication apps/services
    - sdk
    - serverless
  - tech stack
    - webrtc
    - websocket
    - node
    - js/ts
    - gcp
    - redis
- missions
  - develop de-facto standard paas for real-time communication apps/services
- my current contributions
  - develop and maintain systems and library
  - improve developer experience
    - both ours and users
- i'm happy now
  - to contribute to products for developers
  - to work with good project members in good team culture
  - to make use of things i've learned hard until now
    - js/ts
    - web
    - software design/architecture
    - system design/architecture
  - to experience interesting development
    - to develop/maintain real-time and async system is difficult but worth to challenge
    - to develop systems and library for developers needs deep technical knowledge and skills

  - repo: https://github.com/e5pe0n/cpfrp
  - got used to rust a bit
- [Essentials of Programming Languages](https://eopl3.com/)
  - repo: https://github.com/e5pe0n/EoPL
  - finally done!
    - first commit is on Aug 7, 2021; took almost 3 years!
  - learned
    - *scheme* language
    - how to implement languages
      - tokenization
      - parsing
      - type check
      - evaluation
    - language designs
      - i knew that language specifications i took for granted are not the only ways; those specifications are designed based on the language philosophy/concept
    - implementation techniques
      - lexical-addressing
      - [continuation-passing style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)
      - [static dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_dispatch#) and [dynamic dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch)
      - [double dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch)
  - got used to recursion
  - imo
    - oop
      - implementing oop language was difficult due to the complexity; hard to trace where implementation is and which implementation runs
        - this is the same when coding in oop languages
      - i think there are other better language designs

- [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Randal-Bryant-ebook/dp/B09HPD9QBW/)  
  - read again and again to delve into actual implementations

- [A Book of Abstract Algebra](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Charles-C-Pinter-ebook/dp/B00VDGA1JA)
  - wanna read this next, maybe give me hints about
    - how to organize the current cluttered systems/library implementation
    - concept on programming languages/frameworks/libraries
