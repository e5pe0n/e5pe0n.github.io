## Achievements

- Essentials of Programming Languages
  - Re-implemented chapter 3 using SLLGEN
- Hacking: The Art of Exploitation
  - learned about
    - memory segments
    - the foundation of network again
      - how is the content of a packet in binary


## Stacked

- A Book of Abstract Algebra
- [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html)



## Monthly Review

- i could take a break
  - honestly the first half of May i've been burned out and had no motivation
  - that's good once in a while
- Hacking: The Art of Exploitation is interesting
  - i learned the foundation which is necessary for programming again
  - i'm not good at network but i could get interesting in it
  - read raw socket implementations
    - all data flowing on network is simply binary: a sequence of bits
      - which is thought that it should be arranged, following a standard like RFC
      - but we can send binary data by any bit arrangement to hack
  - some knowledge about network was useful for my job
    - building local DNS server using Dnsmasq to access local web app on Mac by hostname from iPad


- wish list
  - learning Rust
    - i'm interesting in the lower part of programming
    - i wanna use static typed language
  - books
    - Fluent Python 2nd Edtion
      - i read the 1st Edition
        - it was very long but the 2nd is twice longer!
      - honestly, recently i don't like python
      - but many project use python so the demand cannot be ignored
    - Mastering Regular Expressions: Understand Your Data and Be More Productive
      - after that, program is a sequence of strings before compiled
      - handling strings can be a hack
      - and regex is powerful enough to make my development more efficient

## Music

- last few years i've almost linstened to instrumental music 
- wish every metal band would stream the intrument version for their all songs...

- artists
  - Hedras
  - Xeuphoria
