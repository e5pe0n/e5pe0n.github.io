## Achievement

- React
- Python
  - FastAPI
    - smaller and simpler then flexible than nonolithic Django
    - we have to composite other tools such as for migrations and for ORM
    - instead, we can customize it for our favor
  - Pydantic
    - better than Django REST framework
    - but doesn't reach at all how we can handle objects far easily in JS/TS
    - so far, replacement Django with FastAPI doesn't solve my demand to backend TS
  - SQLAlchemy
    - API is similar to raw SQL so better to learn and use than Django models and queries
    - i don't want ORM to wrap a logic part of SQL such as join and where or so by like `filter()` or `query()` because they don't abstract them or make them easy to use at all, they just alias them.  
      - i first assemble logic in raw SQL then i have to think of like how do i write this in ORM query API...what a waste of time!
      - most cumbersome when writing raw SQL is to convert result records to objects
      - that's all i want ORM to do
    - query API of SQLAlchemy v2.0 match my demand

      - enable to add type hint to duck typing

- A Book of Abstract Algebra
  - many erratum
  - but the contents give many examples to help understand
  - the level of excercises is easy
    - working by my hand is also help to remember and understand the properties of groups
