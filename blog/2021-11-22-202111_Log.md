## Comments

i learned a lot of things in these three months.    
i really struggled to work them properly and i remberred importance of experiments and experimence; take your time, try the simplest case at first.  

- Back-end
  - AWS
    - CloudFront
    - CloudFormation
    - API Gateway
    - S3
    - DynamoDB
    - Lambda
      - Lambda Layers
  - Python
    - Pytest
- Front-end
  - JavaScript
    - React
    - React Testing Library
    - Next.js
    - Mock Service Worker
    - Jest
  - TypeScript

it was good to learn about JavaScript.  
it is easy to write code in JavaScript and JavaScript supports the functional programming style.  
i found that mastering full-stack skills is sooooooooooooo hard.  
i need to implement the both back-end and front-end, but i can use JavaScript to them.  

i found that it is difficult to use interpreter languages such as Python and JavaScript for productions because of maintainancibility.  
also i know that it is better to use popular languages for googlability and new people to team.   
TypeScript almost meets my requirements so it maybe good to replace Python with it.  
i wish to use a static typed language but there is no one i feel like good...
