title: "Goodbye 2023"

## Summary

- struggled to improve software development and my career as a software engineer
  - engaged in development as a almost tech-lead
  - sought for a new job
- consequently got higher point of view to think of software development
  - domain
  - project
  - software/system design/architecture
- finally got a next new job
  - onboarding from Febuary


## My 2023

|Month|Project|
|:---:|:---:|
|01-03|Education Support System for Elementary & Junior High School|
|04-12|Assistant System for Government Cloud Management|

### Struggled to Move a Project Forward

- project members had been divided into a tech-lead and others; a project manager and other engineers
  - we wanted to make our team more proactive
    - frequent communication
    - sharing technical knowledge and enhancing not only individual skills but also entire team's skills
  - on the other hand, the tech-lead has passive and defensive personality but pride as a tech-lead
  - consequently, our team had so many clashes over every decision
- i learned
  - just to insist on correct opinions was not a way to improve software development
  - need to make good atomosphere and giving team members motivation first to move forward the same goal
- under the circumustance, i guessed changing the human mind and the environment are more challenging
  - i felt this suppressed or indifferent atomosphere is charastaristic of my company, not only of my current project
    - in fact most of the team members of the next project are like that too
  - tended to seek a new environment to work as a software engineer

### Sought the Next Job

- i began to seek for environment where i can experience and involve in more technical work, also a company encourages me to so that
- but i was rejected over and over again
  - i felt down, there seemed a gap between knowledge i had and experience companies required for me
  - especially i found that i focused on micro area in software development such as how to write clean and efficient code, but more macro perspective was required; system design
  - i began to study system design and platform services
    - [Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) was a great book for me; it gave me a lot of new things
    - there are so many trade-offs between system designs/architectures; so careful consideration is needed to accomplish the demand
  - many companies require Golang knowledge or experience
    - studied Golang by reading [Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/)
- it's been so long time but finally i got a next job; provide platform such as libraries for developers and infrastructure for services; fortunately which really fits what i hoped from the first motivation for job-change

### Importance of Domain Knowledge

- while i'd attempted to design a system over and over, one day i found that it's so important for software engineers to get involved themselves into domain problem
  - good software/system architecture/design is robust to change
  - but how do we anticipate to direction to which our software/system will change?
  - it's impossible to build software/system flexible to change without domain knowledge
  - this fact intrinsically leads us to think about the product value of the software that we're creating, communicating with not only technical persons but also UI/UX design teams, sales department, stakeholders and end users
- i began to study DDD from fundamentals by reading [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-tackling/0321125215/)
  - i've felt no need to learn DDD until i noticed importance of involving domain because i've thought it's just one of design patterns of OOP
  - i think the most important part of DDD is how to model/abstract things we want to implement through the common understanding about a domain; ubiquitous language
    - design pattern of OOP is just one of ways to model/abstract them in DDD
    - in fact [Domain Modeling Made Functional: Tackle Software Complexity with Domain-Driven Design and F#](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/) describes how to implement a system based on DDD using functional programming language. it really interested.

### Joined a New Profject

- i left the project of the education support system then joined a new project which develops a system to assist government cloud management from April
  - scrum framework
  - there is no tech-lead position in the team but implicitly i was almost that
    - dedicated to decisions about from what languages, libraries and development tools to use, to coding guidelines and software/system design/architecture
    - proactively participated in meetings, including such as for operators and for UI/UX design team, to collect and make use of domain knowledge for design and implementation
    - document knowledge and decisions to share with team members
    - setup CI/CD
- i learned a lot of new things from infrastructure and backend to frontend
  - scrum
    - i've experienced scrum development but strictly following the framework under scrum coaches is for the first time
  - GCP
  - Terraform
    - CDKTF (TypeScript)
  - monorepo using Turborepo
  - Node.js
  - Next.js
    - React Server Components
  - Figma
  - ADRs

### Advent of Code

- joined for the first time
- fun but hard work to solve a problem everyday
- couldn't solve 5, 6 or so problems
- given motivation to study algorithms again

## 2024 Resolutions

- good luck and have fun!
  - honestly i'm hopeful but also very nervous at the same time
  - don't forget having fun; everything follows that!
