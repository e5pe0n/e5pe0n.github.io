- programmer is encoder
  - he encodes his thought to program
  - can he translate the thought into code without any inconsistency?
    - if he can write code without any inconsistency, he don't need to read the code
    - we're assuming that it is "No" when we use program written by other people
      - maybe there are some bugs in the program
        - syntax is wrong somewhere
        - logic is wrong somewhere
        - some specifications and assumptions are different between us
      - programming can be divided into
        - writing code
        - review the code
      - thus, We have to check somehow the correctness of the program
        - all we can do is actually run the program and confirm the result
- how long can we take time to review code through the project?
  - time we can take to review code is restricted resource
    - time resource = write code + review code
    - therefore there is a limit of the amount of code that we can review
- how do we spare the time to review code?
  - imagine you're reviewing code written by a teamate
    - you read the part of code added or edited newly
    - you run the program and check the result
      - if your teamate didn't write test, you have to manually
        - create test data (input data)
        - run the entire program and preceed to the state of the program where the code written by the teamate is running
        - create (assume) expected data (output data)
        - see the result and then compare it with expected data
  - we can write test to automate such process
    - automate process to create test data (input data)
    - automate process to create expected data (output data)
    - automate process to compare the result with expected data
    - run the program partially in parallel instead of running the entire program
  - by sparing the time to review code
    - we can write the next part of code
    - so the cycle to write and review code runs rapidly
  - writing test is more effective to team development
    - we can reduce duplicate process each one doing
- how should we write test code?
  - test is something cheat
    - test is also program, why don't we need to test the test program?
  - thus we have to write test as simple as we can ensure the test program should run correctly without test code about it
  - the simplest test is just to see and confirm the result, ignoring the details such as inner logic and state
    - if you notice you're writing the test code to test the inner logic and state, maybe you should divide the tested code into more components as simple as we can write simple test
- why is writing test so difficult?
  - there're no differences between writing product code and writing test code on writing code
    - anyone, who is not fluent in the programming i.e. does not know well about the programming language, the system and the specification, cannot write test
  - actual testing code is not simple at all
    - maybe your test code includes external libraries to test
    - you need to learn how to use them
  - conversely, this is demand to people capable to such a complex software development
    - searching result of how to write test is less
    - seems that many people don't have the knowledge
    - those who have the knowledge and develop the skill can win
