# Achievement

- Implementation and Review
  - managed to both implement for assigned tasks to me and review PRs at the same time!
  - felt like surely this is the ideal form for team development
    - respect the programs we write, got some new things from them and develop us each other

- Learned infrastructure and services
  - using these below somehow but I understood exactly what these are doing at last
    - AWS copilot
    - serverless
      - serveless-next.js
  - learned details to improve our development environment
    - docker
    - docker compose

- React
  - got to care about rendering count in these days
    - considering trade off between benefits of declarative (functional) style and performance
  - after all we just treat DOMs somehow
  - react is a great library but not being always the best choice for the project
    - i had been depending on and stick to react 
    - need thinking beyond libraries/frameworks
      - like considering programming languages about not only syntax and built-in functions for easiness to write programs but also performance and implementation details

- *Essentials of Programming Languages*
  - Chapter 5. Continuation-Passing Interpreter
    - 5.3 An Imperative Interpreter done!

- *A Book of Abstract Algebra*
  - Chapter 7. Groups of Permutations done!

- *Jeol on Software*
  - started reading due to hearing that an engineer I respect read and have been influenced by this book
    - this book is old a bit so some things said may be token for granted in these day
    - but foundation, the bottom of thinking how to solve the problems on software development is still alive, there are many things I should reap to develop me
  - 1/3 done reading!

- *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*
  - maybe mostly reviewing the basics for programming
    - the phrase *programmer's perspective* fascinated me
    - there may be some new discoveries
  - Chapter 1 done reading!
    - learned abstraction/concept of computer systems
