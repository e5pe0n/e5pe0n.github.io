# What Next

- make a smartphone app

    - which language?
      - Dart looks good but it seems that i'll suffer from problems such as build errors and dependency errors due to cross platform...
      - probably i'll choose Kotlin and Swift so far.
- learn Rust
  - although the priority is low in my mind
- read
  - Computer Organization and Design MIPS Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface
