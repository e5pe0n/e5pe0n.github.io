## English

- i've read about 20-30 books written in English.
- i've bought Japanese books about math or programming no longer
- i noticed that when there are things difficult to understand in English, they are also difficult in Japanese
- why it's difficult to understand tham is not because the English texts are difficult, just because they themselves are complicated
- if the difference is little, it's better to read and learn about them in English because i can learn and practice English at the same time.

- my English skills are *reading* >> *writing* > *listening* > *speaking*
- *reading* was improved so much
  - i'm no longer in trouble when i read refarences or manuals in English
  - vocabulary is poor
    - there are so many words i can't read
    - i can't understand jokes or parables
- *writing*
