I've read [Coding and ADHD](https://dev.to/abbeyperini/coding-and-adhd-adhd-brains-im1).  
It was very interesting and I have a lot of "me too."  

Currently I go to doctor monthly and take medicine everyday for ADHD.  
Finding medicine that suits me took long time (one year or so).  
After getting to take medicine right for me, I got so calm than before, when I was always like I must to do something (even I don't know what it is).  

Although medicine get me better, it's not that the symptoms are completely gone.  
I often miss a schedule and am late to a meeting even if it is set at calendar like calendar alarm "it's time 5 min before meeting" then me "OK I know it" but I've already forgotten it after 1 min.    
Among some problems, poor working memory and lack of attention to details are critical for me.  
Honestly, almost all programs I write doesn't work at once.  
There are some bugs even if I reviewed the code again and again.  
This is why I stick to writing tests; I deal with this problem by making it pass the tests with a lot of trial and error.  
I've some times thought that programming is not right for me.  
But I couldn't throw away my interesting in programming and I know the stickness to make code correct and clean is also due to my ADHD brain.  
Also, remote work and flextime are merit for programming job.
My concentration on work is terribly erratic; subject to my interesting and feeling.  
The blog says too, listening music get my feeling better and help me work.  
So it's very important for me that I can work when and where I focus on.  
I really struggled to seek a job.  
Now I'm working remotely and flextime, appreciate so much my current company.  

This is what I found recently and the post also says; It's good to give yourself positive feedback, instead of negative one.  
When I was a student in country school I'd belonged to a track and field club and was taught that like you should be hard to yourself as much as possible.  
Also, in those days I didn't know I have ADHD and I'd believed that my strictness and stickness are only my strength.  
So it took long time to change my thoughts.  
Keep my feeling stable as much as possible.
