# Review since Feburary

- one of the busiest days in my life
  - Feburary and March
- develop and release a web app by a team for the first time

## Good

- knowledge about
  - django
    - especially ORM, QuerySet and Q object
- make common react components from scratch
  - such as
    - list select
    - pagination
    - multi-sortable table
    - login required layout
  - i know there are libraries for these components and it's better to use them for a production development
  - but i wanted to write them by my hand once
- write abstract functions in functional fashion in python
  - deep map
  - deep filter
  - deep zip
  - flatten
  - fit
- make github actions
  - auto-deploy
- write sql for data migration
  - make sqls written by a teamate more faster
    - first make a big table by joining source tables, then select from it


## Bad

### wrote a lot of, complex tests

#### I wanted to

- check for any pattern of parameters each test
- make each test more general

#### Why Bad

- hard to maintain tests
  - tests are broken even when i changed source code a bit
  - readers else, other teamates can't understand what the test is for at a glance
    - they should followed the logic in the test
    - they need to debug to make the failed test pass
    - it's much burden to write tests like so by themselves
      - tests are written not only by me but also teamates

#### So I should

- prefer simplicity to generality when it's difficult to make a test general while keeping the simplicity
  - **writing tests that cannot be maintained is the same as not writing tests at all**
  - it's a good and sipmle method for getting a test more general to make factory methods (fixtures) to make objects used in tests repeatedly
  - don't use *if* statement in a test
    - divide the test into two or more
  - keep the number of objects used in a test the least
- don't repeat the same test cases tested in other tests
  - if the same test cases should be checked in several tests, it might be good to modularize source code to separate the test cases

# BTW

## Windows > Mac for me now

- peformance of docker on mac is too poor
  - slow
  - typescript extension and prettier in vscode remote container often die
- linux compatibility
  - i can use ubuntu in windowns thanks to WSL
- mouse > trackpad
  - my shoulder, arm and hand often hurts using trackpad
- keyboard
  - mac compatible keyboards less
    - mac compatible mechanical keyboards much less
    - HHK is out because of the keyboard layout
    - i had no choice but to use [realforce](https://www.realforce.co.jp/products/R2TLSA-US3M-BK/) but ... i don't like realforce keyboard so much
      - (why USB is type-A but for mac?)
  - [HyperX Alloy FPS Pro](https://www.hyperxgaming.com/en/keyboards/alloy-fps-pro-mechanical-gaming-keyboard) is the best keyboard for me now
    - (although i don't play FPS)
- cost
  - mac is too expensive

## Team Development

- **do write documents and tests**
  - don't think that it's ok if i know it or i can do it
  - if there is no document and test
    - new teamate will take long time to understand the project, the system and the source code
      - we cannot get help when we want help
    - we cannot share information about our project
      - we don't want to touch the thing we don't know well
        - motivateion and teamwork down
      - we have to explain about our project reatedly
        - it's lazy to explain so some part of work get more dependent on one developer
    - developer also need to maintain the developed part by him/herself
      - because only he/she knows about how it works
