# Job

- Scrum
  - joined scrum training
    - i had once but i had forgot many elemental things  


- TypeScript
  - i have really good development experience
  - strong static analysis
    - type errors, suggestions, etc.
  - structual typing
    - flexble to use
  - functional style
    - i wish JS supports more functional features
      - lazy evaluation on functions such as `map()` and `filter()`
      - if expression, switch expression  

- GCP
  - Firebase
    - i hadn't touch it although i knew the name
    - seems easier to use for simple web apps than using aws
  - i feel it is simpler than aws
    - i don't know that is beacuse i've used aws or aws is complex


- GitHub Actions
  - parallelized jobs to shorten elapsed time

- GraphQL
  - tried tutorials of [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
  - can we get better development experience using GraphQL with TS?
    - typing by TS and GraphQL is duplicate
    - i feel TS might be enough for type validation
      - after all we have to runtime-validations for values too
    - at least i feel introducing GraphQL doesn't match the cost for the current system

# Others

- i wanna change my job soon
  - i had no offers still now...
  - i wanna develop softwares more technically difficult
    - bored now
  - recently also interested in infrastructures
    - IaC, system architectures


# In Progress

- [Go Programming Language](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/)
  - started learning golang because there are many company adopt golang
  - workspace repo: https://github.com/e5pe0n/gpl
  - Chapter 1 - 7
    - done!
  - for me
    - golang is not simple at all as others say so
      - pointers
      - goroutines and channels
    - i've thought that golang was a low-layer language like C/C++ but was made more easier to treat, but that was wrong; it's high-level language than i think so, truly general perpose language
      - standard library looks large and enough to develop web app
    - one of the good candidates in static typed languages for web app
      - prep to dev is easy; batteries included
        - package manager, linter, formatter, etc.
      - ecosystem and support from vendors is sufficient
        - libraries, cdk, sdk, etc
      - performance
      - compiled to executable binary
        - no need something like JVM
      - good compatible to docker containers
    - i hadn't liked golang, and i don't like it now too even my perspective for golang was changed
      - there are too many places side-effects occur
        - hard to track procedures correctly
          - the more i learn golang, the more i wanna use rust  



- [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Randal-Bryant-ebook/dp/B09HPD9QBW/)  
  - Chapter 3 - 8
    - done reading!
    - it seams more clearer about low layer than before 
      - processor architectures
      - memory systems
        - registers
        - L1-L3 cache
      - exceptions
  - Chapter 9. Virtual Memory
    - very important but also too difficult
    - mechanism of translation from virtual memory to physical memory is too complicated

## Push onto the Stack

honestly i don't wanna push these onto the stack but skills to be able to use instantly needed now for recruit.

- [A Book of Abstract Algebra](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Charles-C-Pinter-ebook/dp/B00VDGA1JA)
  - done!
