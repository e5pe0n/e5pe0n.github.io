# Job

- implemented technically difficult features
  - write script to tokenize python code then remove parts of code temporally when migrating the database using postgres_fdw
  - read the public form from the excel file then render as a form on web page
  - using opencv-python to align the preview image of the public form
- reviewed PRs from team members
  - i committed as both main implementer and main reviewer, but this was bad idea
  - because the workload overflowed my capacity and i myself didn't have the right to determine specification
- deployed new features to staging environment
  - a lot of bugs found when integrating frontend and backend

# Others

- i couldn't do self-education enough in January and February, my job was too busy for release
  - i'm really tired, on both physically and mentally
- current my team is not a team, just a black company
  - current tech lead is a client, and other implementers are just labor to deliver any product from code to documentations to him
  - i wanted to share technical knowledge and talk about it more, make effective our development more, and have fun more above all
  - i'm sure that i did my best; i implemented technically difficult parts, helped my team members develop, and that actually committed to the release. but why i have such a sad feeling...
- determined move me to other project
  - i agreed to that because it didn't seem that i can learn anything more, leverage my skill, and enjoy the development in the current team
  - also i feel stuck, the experience in other project might be need for me to extend my perspective
- i'm seeking the next job
  - applied for about 15 company, but i haven't have any offers now...
    - almost all of them were dropped at screening process
    - i'm really feeling that i'm inexperienced, unskilled, behind, indifferent, and ignorant...
    - but it was worth to apply for recruitments, i could know current my actual values
  - first of all i haven't been able to find jobs i interested in at all
    - business/services
      - i wanna work in the field such as science and technology
      - recruitments of companies in these fields are really less and require high education and skills
    - techs
      - languages used by almost all web company are Java, PHP, Ruby and Go
      - i can't have interest on them at all...
