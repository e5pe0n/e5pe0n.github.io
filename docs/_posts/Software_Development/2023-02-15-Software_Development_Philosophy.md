# Discipline

- we must own up to our shortcomings--our ignorance and our mistakes.  
- provide options, don't make lame excuses
  - before you approach anyone to tell them why something can't be done, is late, or is broken, stop and **listen to yourself.**  
- don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired.  
  - decadence is contagious  


# Refactoring

- put priority on consitency
  - even when coming to mind better implementation
  - it just become an exception in the entire software design, that increases the complexity and tends to lose the order
