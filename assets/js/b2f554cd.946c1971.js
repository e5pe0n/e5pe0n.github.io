a project manager and other engineers\\n  - we wanted to make our team more proactive\\n    - frequent communication\\n    - sharing technical knowledge and enhancing not only individual skills but also entire team\'s skills\\n  - on the other hand, the tech-lead has passive and defensive personality but pride as a tech-lead\\n  - consequently, our team had so many clashes over every decision\\n- i learned\\n  - just to insist on correct opinions was not a way to improve software development\\n  - need to make good atomosphere and giving team members motivation first to move forward the same goal\\n- under the circumustance, i guessed changing the human mind and the environment are more challenging\\n  - i felt this suppressed or indifferent atomosphere is charastaristic of my company, not only of my current project\\n    - in fact most of the team members of the next project are like that too\\n  - tended to seek a new environment to work as a software engineer\\n\\n### Sought the Next Job\\n\\n- i began to seek for environment where i can experience and involve in more technical work, also a company encourages me to so that\\n- but i was rejected over and over again\\n  - i felt down, there seemed a gap between knowledge i had and experience companies required for me\\n  - especially i found that i focused on micro area in software development such as how to write clean and efficient code, but more macro perspective was required; system design\\n  - i began to study system design and platform services\\n    - [Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) was a great book for me; it gave me a lot of new things\\n    - there are so many trade-offs between system designs/architectures; so careful consideration is needed to accomplish the demand\\n  - many companies require Golang knowledge or experience\\n    - studied Golang by reading [Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/)\\n- it\'s been so long time but finally i got a next job; provide platform such as libraries for developers and infrastructure for services; fortunately which really fits what i hoped from the first motivation for job-change\\n\\n### Importance of Domain Knowledge\\n\\n- while i\'d attempted to design a system over and over, one day i found that it\'s so important for software engineers to get involved themselves into domain problem\\n  - good software/system architecture/design is robust to change\\n  - but how do we anticipate to direction to which our software/system will change?\\n  - it\'s impossible to build software/system flexible to change without domain knowledge\\n  - this fact intrinsically leads us to think about the product value of the software that we\'re creating, communicating with not only technical persons but also UI/UX design teams, sales department, stakeholders and end users\\n- i began to study DDD from fundamentals by reading [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-tackling/0321125215/)\\n  - i\'ve felt no need to learn DDD until i noticed importance of involving domain because i\'ve thought it\'s just one of design patterns of OOP\\n  - i think the most important part of DDD is how to model/abstract things we want to implement through the common understanding about a domain; ubiquitous language\\n    - design pattern of OOP is just one of ways to model/abstract them in DDD\\n    - in fact [Domain Modeling Made Functional: Tackle Software Complexity with Domain-Driven Design and F#](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/) describes how to implement a system based on DDD using functional programming language. it really interested.\\n\\n### Joined a New Profject\\n\\n- i left the project of the education support system then joined a new project which develops a system to assist government cloud management from April\\n  - scrum framework\\n  - there is no tech-lead position in the team but implicitly i was almost that\\n    - dedicated to decisions about from what languages, libraries and development tools to use, to coding guidelines and software/system design/architecture\\n    - proactively participated in meetings, including such as for operators and for UI/UX design team, to collect and make use of domain knowledge for design and implementation\\n    - document knowledge and decisions to share with team members\\n    - setup CI/CD\\n- i learned a lot of new things from infrastructure and backend to frontend\\n  - scrum\\n    - i\'ve experienced scrum development but strictly following the framework under scrum coaches is for the first time\\n  - GCP\\n  - Terraform\\n    - CDKTF (TypeScript)\\n  - monorepo using Turborepo\\n  - Node.js\\n  - Next.js\\n    - React Server Components\\n  - Figma\\n  - ADRs\\n\\n### Advent of Code\\n\\n- joined for the first time\\n- fun but hard work to solve a problem everyday\\n- couldn\'t solve 5, 6 or so problems\\n- given motivation to study algorithms again\\n\\n## 2024 Resolutions\\n\\n- good luck and have fun!\\n  - honestly i\'m hopeful but also very nervous at the same time\\n  - don\'t forget having fun;

more useful for form validation than Zod\\n\\n### Backend\\n\\n#### [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)\\n\\n- monolithic web app framework\\n- i don\'t like monolithic\\n  - especially ORM query\\n    - why do i have to write raw sqls then struggle to rewrite them in ORM query?\\n  - i wanna combine simple and useful tools in my favor\\n\\n#### [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)\\n\\n- light and fast web app framework\\n- i prefer this to Django\\n  - simpler and i can use SQLAlchemy for query\\n  - but i don\'t like to use python to implement web app in the first place\\n- using FastAPI instead of Django doesn\'t give me big improvement for development experience\\n- i feel like implementing web app is verbose somehow\\n\\n#### [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)\\n\\n- database toolkit for python\\n- query API is similar to raw sql\\n\\n#### [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)\\n\\n- data validation and serializer using type annotations\\n- using type annotations is kinda hucky\\n  - actually python 3.10 and 3.11 didn\'t standardize `__future__.annotation` mainly due to FastAPI and pydantic\\n  - personally i think it\'s difficult to use type strictly in python\\n\\n#### [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\\n\\n- library to manipulate table data\\n- used to process excel files possibly having numerous data\\n- i could manage to implement although it was long time since i had used last\\n\\n### Others\\n\\n#### [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)\\n\\n- E2E test library\\n- writing and maintaining E2E tests are too hard\\n  -

Feburary and March\\n- develop and release a web app by a team for the first time\\n\\n### Good\\n\\n- knowledge about\\n  - django\\n    - especially ORM, QuerySet and Q object\\n- make common react components from scratch\\n  - such as\\n    - list select\\n    - pagination\\n    - multi-sortable table\\n    - login required layout\\n  - i know there are libraries for these components and it\'s better to use them for a production development\\n  -

auto-deploy\\n- write sql for data migration\\n  - make sqls written by a teamate more faster\\n    - first make a big table by joining source tables, then select from it\\n\\n\\n### Bad\\n\\n#### wrote a lot of, complex tests\\n\\n##### I wanted to\\n\\n- check for any pattern of parameters each test\\n- make each test more general\\n\\n##### Why Bad\\n\\n- hard to maintain tests\\n  - tests are broken even when i changed source code a bit\\n  - readers else, other teamates can\'t understand what the test is for at a glance\\n    - they should followed the logic in the test\\n    - they need to debug to make the failed test pass\\n    - it\'s much burden to write tests like so by themselves\\n      - tests are written not only by me but also teamates\\n\\n##### So I should\\n\\n- prefer simplicity to generality when it\'s difficult to make a test general while keeping the simplicity\\n  - **writing tests that cannot be maintained is the same as not writing tests at all**\\n  - it\'s a good and sipmle method for getting a test more general to make factory methods (fixtures) to make objects used in tests repeatedly\\n  - don\'t use *if* statement in a test\\n    - divide the test into two or more\\n  - keep the number of objects used in a test the least\\n- don\'t repeat the same test cases tested in other tests\\n  - if the same test cases should be checked in several tests, it might be good to modularize source code to separate the test cases\\n\\n\\n\\n## BTW\\n\\n### Windows > Mac for me now\\n\\n- peformance of docker on mac is too poor\\n  - slow\\n  - typescript extension and prettier in vscode remote container often die\\n- linux compatibility\\n  - i can use ubuntu in windowns thanks to WSL\\n- mouse > trackpad\\n  - my shoulder, arm and hand often hurts using trackpad\\n- keyboard\\n  - mac compatible keyboards less\\n    - mac compatible mechanical keyboards much less\\n    - HHK is out because of the keyboard layout\\n    - i had no choice but to use [realforce](https://www.realforce.co.jp/products/R2TLSA-US3M-BK/) but ... i don\'t like realforce keyboard so much\\n      - (why USB is type-A but for mac?)\\n  - [HyperX Alloy FPS Pro](https://www.hyperxgaming.com/en/keyboards/alloy-fps-pro-mechanical-gaming-keyboard) is the best keyboard for me now\\n    - (although i don\'t play FPS)\\n- cost\\n  - mac is too expensive\\n\\n### Team Development\\n\\n- **do write documents and tests**\\n  - don\'t think that it\'s ok if i know it or i can do it\\n  - if there is no document and test\\n    - new teamate will take long time to understand the project, the system and the source code\\n      - we cannot get help when we want help\\n    - we cannot share information about our project\\n      - we don\'t want to touch the thing we don\'t know well\\n        - motivateion and teamwork down\\n      - we have to explain about our project reatedly\\n        - it\'s lazy to explain so some part of work get more dependent on one developer\\n    - developer also need to maintain the developed part by him/herself\\n      -

i can write code easily.\\n    - i can write both frontend and backend in just JS/TS only.\\n      - i knew that it\'s hard so much to keep learning and using some languages in practice.\\n    - rich syntaxies and language features\\n      - array function\\n        - this is a very big feature to those who like functional style.\\n      - spread syntax, object destruction, promise, await/async etc\\n    - transpile\\n      - always work in the newest JS/TS version\\n        - JS has many pitfalls that are awkward and surprise novices.\\n        - new syntaxies or language structures have been released to replace them although old ones will remain in the future for backward-compatibility.\\n        - but we can always write program safely and comfortably in the newest JS/TS version, then transpile it to a target older version so we don\'t worry about the old language features.\\n      - prototyping or tracer bullet\\n        - i can ignore compile errors from TS and emit the build product anyway.\\n        - this flexibility is useful for prototyping or tracer bullet\\n          - in early stage, implement roughly to think of specification details\\n          - then gradually get it strict for realistic system\\n    - static analysis\\n      - i can catch bugs not at runtime but at compile time\\n      - type safe\\n        - TS gives me useful infomation about a variable, funciton, or so when i\'m writing code\\n        - TS notifies me even typos by using *String Union*\\n    - structural type\\n      - it\'s more flexible and useful for web development than nominal type\\n  - it\'s popular\\n    - someone said that googlability is preferable to language goodness. it\'s one of truths\\n    - supported by many services and platforms\\n      - AWS\\n    - a lot of frameworks and libraries provided by communities\\n- demand to master JS\\n  - JS is popular but i feel that those mastering JS is less than i expect\\n\\n#### Python\\n\\n- i still think that Python is a good language\\n  - simple syntax\\n  - useful language features and built-in functions\\n  - we can run an implementation anyway because of dynamically interpreted.\\n  - we can add type infomation using *typehint*.\\n  - popular\\n    - many books about Python\\n    - many services and platforms support Python\\n    - many libraries and platforms published by communities\\n- but i feel that it might not satisfy strictness to develop a production.  \\n  - type system is insufficient\\n    - VSCode often doesn\'t show up type information even when using *typehint*\\n    - these is no compile time error; just all occur runtime\\n  - less maintainancibility\\n    - there is no constant variable in Python\\n- for my preference\\n  - the syntax is not for functional sytle\\n    - not type safe\\n    - *lambda* function can be written in only one line\\n    - it\'s difficult to chain functions\\n\\n#### Haskell/Scheme\\n\\n- writing programs in Haskell and Scheme was very good excercise to implement logics in functional programming style.  \\n  - i got familiar with the recursion.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\n#### Test\\n\\n- i wrote tests right for the first time.\\n- i spent a lot of time to learn how to write tests, and implement actually and run tests properly...\\n  - Pytest\\n  - Jest\\n  - React Testing Library\\n    - not easy to use...\\n    - GUI test is more difficult than tests for backend.\\n    - i don\'t know React design pattern to make tests easy.\\n      - i can\'t divide a form component into API fetching and renderer.\\n- i knew that writing test take more time than implementing features.\\n  - it makes me to consider testability while implementing features.\\n    - i got to be to prefer functional programming style.  \\n\\n### Algorithms\\n\\n- AtCoder and *Cracking the Coding Interview* was very good practice to implement algorithms.\\n  - when i\'m in trouble to implement logics in ordinal development declined.\\n  - i can easily modify an existing data structure or implement a new custom data structure if needed\\n- search algorithms such as DFS and BFS is most useful for me.\\n  - i can manage to implement so many logic using DFS if i can ignore the time complexity.\\n  - to constrast, i\'ve had no chance to use algorithms regard to the number theory in app developement.\\n\\n### AWS\\n\\n- i was astonished by the number of services and configurability at first.\\n  - examples in official docs are too few so i had to had so many trials and errors to deploy properly.\\n  - i knew that each service has the depth to experiment and configure options to optimize the perfomance.\\n  - but i could know the convinience of cloud service and the power of infrustructure as a code.  \\n    - i implemented a web app backend in a template file.\\n      - we can manage infrustructures in VCS\\n      - we can copy it and create the same another environment easily\\n      - we can deploy and delete it easily\\n- i didn\'t take exam for Certified Solution Architect finally.\\n  - i want to use time for other things to learn and i feel that it\'s better to work actually rather than memorize details including possibly unnecessary knowledge\\n\\n### English\\n\\n- i\'ve read about 20-30 books written in English this year.\\n- i\'ve bought Japanese books about math or programming no longer.\\n  - i noticed that when there are things difficult to understand in English, they are also difficult in Japanese.\\n  - why it\'s difficult to understand them is not because the English texts are difficult, just because they themselves are complicated.\\n  - if the difference is little, it\'s better to read and learn about them in English because i can learn and practice English at the same time.\\n\\n- my English skills are *reading* >> *writing* > *listening* > *speaking*.\\n  - *reading* was improved so much.\\n    - i\'m no longer in trouble when i read refarences or manuals in English.\\n    - vocabulary is still poor.\\n      - there are so many words i can\'t read.\\n      - i can\'t understand jokes or parables.\\n      - i don\'t know about casual or daily English at all\\n        - i\'m now just specific to programming or math.\\n  - *writing*\\n    - writing is still slow but i feel it get to be better.\\n    - i became to be able to write documents about sysmtes or tools.\\n    - i can\'t write casual English.\\n      - i can\'t chat by chat apps.\\n  - *listening*, *speaking*\\n    - it\'s stil not good but improved by\\n      - watching youtube videos, explaining programming launguages, frameworks, algorithms or so, with CC feature.\\n      - reading books aloud\\n\\n## What Next?\\n\\n- i want to implement a middle or large system\\n- i want to make apps\\n  - my blog\\n    - i want this to be a platform to exhibit my implementations\\n      - not only interesting but also entertainable or artistic\\n  - study app\\n    - like *izanami jinja* i made before\\n- i want to read\\n  -
